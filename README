Squadwar V2
Author: Cliff Gordon

This is the Squadwar code dump, ported from Coldfusion to PHP.  There is a
database creation script in the admin folder, and a script to generate the
Sector inserts from an input file, so each league could have a simply
generated map.  Just be sure to open the conf/ folder and copy and fill out
the mysql.conf and config.php files.
